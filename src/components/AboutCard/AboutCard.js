          <strong>Hello World!</strong><br />
          My name is <strong>Sean Marjason</strong> <span>&</span><br />
          Iâ€™m a <strong>Web Developer</strong> <span>&</span> <strong>Technologist</strong><br />
          <span>currently based in London, UK</span>

          We study, we work, we travel, we live, we repeat ... but like all good Business Analysts, 
          I have to ask <strong>why</strong>? (and <strong>why</strong>, and <strong>why</strong>, 
          and <strong>why</strong>, and <strong>why</strong> again!)
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, I used to just ask why ... now, I take it a step further. <u>Now, I can build stuff</u>! 
        </p>
        <p>
          I build platforms, products, applications to <strong>invoke change </strong>
          and <strong>solve problems</strong>. Sometimes these are <i>simple</i> problems, 
          sometimes they are <i>known</i>, but sometimes they are 
          <i> novel</i>, <i>complex</i>, and <strong>exciting</strong>.
