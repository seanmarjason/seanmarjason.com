      companies have not moved to a fully remove working model. This site aims 
      to be an ongoing investigation into the reasons for a lack of movement 
      towards remote working as standard, and what needs to be done to make it

      I had a portfolio site in the past, it was done back when I only knew 
      basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It definitely needed an upgrade. What you 
      see now comes from my experience working with ReactJS, as well as various 
      experiments I needed a place to do.`,
