      <p>While I had already created a basic website using the "all powerful" Wordpress, I wanted to challenge myself to create my own site from scratch. Adding in the styles, interactions, and content that I WANT to include, rather than relying on generic templates.</p>
      <p>This project started with an initial design. Taking tips from Steve Krug's "Don't Make Me Think" and inspiration from a wide array of sources including other websites, interesting illustrations, and of course my favourite set designs of all, Blade Runner both old and new!, I prepared an initial set of designs in Balsamiq.</p>
      <p>Then, taking a mobile-first approach, the site came together.</p>
