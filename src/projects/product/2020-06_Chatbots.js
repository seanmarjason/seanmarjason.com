        Today's public would recognise the original user interfaces as the stuff out of 
        movies. Sitting at a terminal, typing text into Command Lines, and watching as 
        the compute power of the machine is displayed in lines of text passing across the 
        screen. Thankfully, for the non-tech-savvy user, graphical user interfaces and 
        the era of the mouse soon followed. Nowadays, we have become accustomed to the use 
        of incredibly powerful devices right in our pockets, that introduced us to the new 
        world of touchscreens and gestures.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what comes next? What is the next wave of interaction that we, as users of ever 
        more powerful machines, will have the pleasure of using? As fans of science fiction, 
        it seems natural that we want to move forward with intelligent, voice driven 
        assistants, that can bring us extensive computing power with just a word or phrase. 
        But the intricacies of human conversation are in no way easy to replicate.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are now so many voice assistant builders out there, with both the mega-firms 
        of Silicon Valley and small scale start ups around the world working on ways that 
        we can build intelligent assistants.
      </p>
      <p>
        This will be an interesting space to watch, and I can't wait to play with the 
        technologies that come out of these firms.
